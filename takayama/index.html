    <b>Reveiw</b>
    <li>Here is my opinion on Takayama, and if you should go!</li><ul>
      <li>I think Takayama is a great place to visit! Culture and tradition are all over the place and you will never be bored. The food in Takayama is very good as well, it is made of passed-down recipes full of love and tradition, filling it with flavor and happiness. The prices are also more convenient for you because $1 is ¥150, making buying things way more affordable. It is full of fun places and relics to see and check out, like the Jigokudani Monkey Park and the Kusakabe Folk Crafts Museum. It is a fun escape from work or school, and is fun for just one or the whole fam! I hope to see you in Takayama soon!</li>
